# nymity
A grpah DB based on PG and UName*It

UName\*It was an object-oriented, "network" (meaning "graph") database that existed from c. 1996 through c. 2001.  I worked at the only customer that deployed it in production, and my then employer got source code when the vendor closed shop.  I became the maintainer of UName\*It, so I know it well, and I miss it.

This will be a proof of concept at least, and perhaps functional enough to actually make it usable in production.

All work on Nymity at this time is pending approval from `$WORK`'s Legal.
